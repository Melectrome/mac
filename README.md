#Instructions
To install the configs, put all of the config files (inscluding the mac_comp_whitelist.txt file) into your orangebox/tf/cfg folder.
To run a config, type in console "exec [configname]" (You need to replace "configname" with the name of the config you want to run).
To keep the config running after map changes, add the same exec line as above into your server.cfg file.
